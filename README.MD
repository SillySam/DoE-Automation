# Duke of Edinburgh Award API

This project is base for automating log entries in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Program (www.onlinerecordbook.org).
API is minimal, only containing the needed functionality for adding and reading activityies.

This could be paired with the `schedule` library and a list of prewritten notes and left to run.
