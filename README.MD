# Duke of Edinburgh Award Automation

This project allows activities to be written in a cluster, then with scheduling, entering these into the dashboard at the appropriate time.

#### Usage:

1. Add email and password details into the `config.py` file.

2. Run the program 'duke_of_ed.py' by using the command

   â€‹	`python3 duke_of_ed.py`

3. A `tasks.json` file will be generated. With this, fill in the 'description' list with as many weeks worth of 'stuff'

4. Run the script again and leave running!
